                In an interview by director Steven Watson for the platform's Magazine Club blog, editor-in-chief Mirna Belina and assistant editor Hannah Pezzack discuss the process behind compiling Ecoes; from essayistic texts to interviews, experimental writing, and design choices. They dive into the material socio-political specificities of melting ice, floods, and contaminative poetry, querying how to move beyond the human in response to the environmental crisis.
